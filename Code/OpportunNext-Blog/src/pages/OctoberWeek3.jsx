            Week 3: Project Proposal & Strategy (October 15-21)

        <p>
          This week, we officially proposed <strong>OpportuNext</strong>, an AI-powered job-matching engine, and mapped out our implementation plan. Alexander focused on backend development and machine learning, while Mahmoud handled frontend and user experience. Our strategy included data preprocessing, model training, and UI development. Challenges like Djangoâ€™s REST framework, React state management, and model optimization helped refine our skills. Week 3 was crucial in aligning our goals, and we now shift our focus to improving our model and UI.
