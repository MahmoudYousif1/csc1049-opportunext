            Week 4: Finalizing UI & User Experience (January 22-31)

        The final week of January was dedicated to polishing the main home page, refining the styling of the navbar, and improving the login and home components. Our goal was to ensure that the platform not only looked visually appealing but also provided a seamless and intuitive user experience.

For the home page, we focused on optimizing the layout, fine-tuning typography, and ensuring that key content was easy to access. We refined visual elements such as spacing, images, and section alignments to create a more engaging and professional look. Additionally, we improved responsiveness, ensuring that the design adapted smoothly across different screen sizes.

The navbar also received significant attention. We improved its styling by adjusting colors, hover effects, and dropdown animations to create a more polished look. We also ensured better usability by refining link placements and optimizing the navigation structure, making it easier for users to find what they need quickly.

Another major focus was on refining the login and home components. We enhanced form styling, improved input validation, and fine-tuned error messaging to make the authentication process clearer and more user-friendly. The home component was also optimized for performance, ensuring faster load times and a smoother experience when navigating between sections.
