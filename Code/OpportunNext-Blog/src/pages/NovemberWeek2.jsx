            Week 2: Minor Fixes & Formatting Adjustments (November 8-14)
          </h1>
        </header>

        <p>
          This week was dedicated to making minor fixes and formatting adjustments across our documentation. We addressed spacing issues, font inconsistencies, and figure placements to enhance the documentâ€™s readability. Additionally, we ensured that all images and diagrams were correctly labeled and referenced. While no major development took place, these refinements contributed to the overall polish of our project materials.
