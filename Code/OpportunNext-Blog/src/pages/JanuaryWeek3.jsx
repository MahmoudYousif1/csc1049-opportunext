        This week, we dedicated our efforts to enhancing the UI components to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Our goal was to ensure that every interface element—from buttons and forms to navigation menus and interactive components—felt intuitive and cohesive. We refined the design system by improving spacing, typography, and color contrasts, ensuring better readability and accessibility across different devices. Additionally, we introduced subtle animations and transitions to make interactions feel smoother and more engaging.

Beyond UI improvements, we also focused on refining the authentication system. Security and ease of access were our top priorities, so we made several key updates to strengthen login and registration processes. We optimized password handling, improved session management, and ensured better validation for user credentials. Additionally, we refined error messaging and feedback prompts to guide users through the authentication flow more effectively.
