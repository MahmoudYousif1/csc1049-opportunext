        <p>
        This week, we began by importing job listings from a CSV file. This process involved parsing and cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency before storing it in the database. We also implemented error handling to catch any inconsistencies in the data, preventing duplicate or incomplete entries.

In addition, we created a Job model, defining the necessary fields such as job title, company, location, salary range, job type, and description. This structured approach made it easier to manage and query job listings efficiently.

To further enhance the user experience, we installed Haystack, a powerful search library, to improve search functionality. This integration allowed us to implement more advanced search capabilities, such as filtering by keywords, location, and job type, making it easier for users to find relevant listings quickly.

Beyond data integration and search enhancements, we also worked on displaying job data more accurately. We optimized how job listings were presented on the frontend, ensuring a clean layout with clear formatting, structured details, and better readability. Users can now browse job listings more intuitively, with essential information easily accessible at a glance.

Finally, we refined the styling for the main homepage, enhancing its visual appeal and usability. This involved adjusting typography, improving spacing, and ensuring consistency across elements to create a more polished and professional look.
