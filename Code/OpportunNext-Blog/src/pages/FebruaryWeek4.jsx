            Week 4: Documentation & Final Touches (February 18-21)
          </h1>
        </header>

        <p>
        This week, we focused on finalizing documentation and cleaning up the codebase to improve maintainability and ensure a smoother development process moving forward. Our goal was to create clear, well-structured documentation while optimizing the code for better readability and efficiency.

One of our key tasks was adding Pydoc documentation to improve code clarity. We documented functions, classes, and modules, ensuring that future developers  can quickly understand the purpose and functionality of different components. This documentation will be especially useful for onboarding new team members and making future updates more manageable.

In addition to adding documentation, we also updated comments throughout the codebase, ensuring that complex logic and key processes were clearly explained. This helps maintain transparency in the code and makes debugging or future modifications easier.

As part of our cleanup efforts, we removed unused components and redundant code. Over time, various functions and modules had become outdated or unnecessary, so we identified and eliminated those to streamline the codebase. This not only reduced clutter but also improved performance and maintainability.

To ensure everything was functioning as expected, we conducted integration tests. These tests focused on verifying that different parts of the system—such as authentication, job searches, user interactions, and API calls—worked seamlessly together.
