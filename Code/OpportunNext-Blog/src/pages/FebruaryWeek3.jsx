            Week 3: UI/UX Improvements & API Enhancements (February 15-18)
          </h1>
        </header>

        <p>
        This week, our primary focus was on improving the UI and enhancing the API to create a more seamless and user-friendly experience. We made significant refinements to the platformâ€™s design, ensuring that elements were visually appealing, intuitive, and optimized for different screen sizes.

On the UI side, we worked on adjusting styling, fonts, and layouts to improve readability and overall usability. We fine-tuned typography for better text clarity, optimized color contrasts for accessibility, and refined spacing to create a more balanced and structured layout. These updates made the interface cleaner, easier to navigate, and more visually cohesive across different devices.

In addition to UI improvements, we focused on enhancing the API by updating API endpoints to improve how account details are managed. These changes allowed for more efficient data retrieval and updates, making it easier for users to manage their profiles, update preferences, and interact with job listings. We also optimized response times, ensuring a smoother and faster experience when interacting with the platform.

Another key enhancement was improving the search bar functionality. We refined the way search queries are processed, improving filtering and keyword matching to provide more relevant results. Whether users search for jobs by title, location, or category, they now receive more accurate and dynamic suggestions, enhancing their ability to find relevant listings quickly.
