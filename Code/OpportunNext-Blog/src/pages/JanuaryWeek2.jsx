            Week 2: Refining User Experience (January 8-14)
          </h1>
        </header>

        <p>
        This week, our primary focus was on revamping the homepage to create a more engaging and user-friendly experience. The previous design lacked clarity and ease of access, so we refined the layout, improved the visual hierarchy, and ensured that key information was more accessible. This involved optimizing content placement, enhancing responsiveness for different devices, and refining the overall aesthetic to better align with the platformâ€™s goals.

In addition to the homepage improvements, we also worked on enhancing the navigation flow. We restructured menus, refined link placements, and ensured smoother transitions between sections, making it easier for users to find what they need without unnecessary clicks. These adjustments significantly improved usability and made the overall browsing experience more intuitive.

Another critical area of focus was updating views and URLs related to user registration and login. Previously, the authentication system had some inefficiencies, such as unclear redirections and inconsistent user flows. To resolve this, we streamlined the routing logic, making it more logical and user-friendly. We also refined the UI for the login and sign-up pages, ensuring a smoother and more secure authentication process.
