        <p>
          This week, we presented <strong>OpportuNext</strong>, highlighting its personalized job-matching, efficient search, and data-driven insights. Alexander focused on data processing and machine learning, while Mahmoud developed the frontend and API integration using Django, React, and MySQL. We tackled challenges in model fine-tuning, real-time data handling, and database queries. The demonstration confirmed our project's feasibility, earning approval to proceed. Next, weâ€™ll refine backend algorithms, enhance frontend features, and begin integration testing.
