        <p>
          This week, we presented six project ideas to our supervisor, Michael Scriney, who provided valuable feedback on feasibility, impact, and team strengths. After careful evaluation, we selected the **Smart Job Matcher** due to its strong potential for real-world application, availability of job data, and alignment with our AI/ML expertise. We then discovered a comprehensive job postings dataset with diverse featuresâ€”essential for building an effective matching algorithm. With a clear focus and dataset in hand, we are now ready to move forward with development.
