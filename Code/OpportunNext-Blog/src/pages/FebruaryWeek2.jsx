            Week 2: Refining Features & Testing (February 8-14)
          </h1>

        <p>
        This week, we focused on implementing and testing new features to enhance both functionality and user experience. Our primary goal was to ensure that key platform components operated smoothly and efficiently while introducing improvements to search and account management.

One of our major tasks was unit testing for critical features, including user creation, job card display, and CV uploads. By writing and running unit tests, we ensured that user registration and authentication worked correctly, that job listings were displayed accurately, and that users could successfully upload their CVs without errors. These tests helped us identify and resolve potential issues early, improving the platformâ€™s reliability.

Additionally, we integrated Elasticsearch to provide more advanced job search capabilities. This upgrade allowed for faster and more relevant search results by enabling full-text search, filtering, and ranking job postings based on relevance. With Elasticsearch, users can now search for jobs more efficiently, using keywords, job categories, locations, and other filters to refine their results.

Another key improvement was the implementation of account management for logged-in users. We developed features that allow users to update their profiles, manage saved jobs, and track their application history. These enhancements made it easier for users to interact with the platform, providing a more personalized experience.
